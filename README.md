## Head Heavy Rackets
Head Heavy racquets are also called **power racquets**. More weight is distributed at the top of the racket head, giving you more momentum in your swing. This produces more powerful shots. Badminton Clears are mostly effortless; Smashes are often deadly. It is suitable if you are an aggressive player, playing mostly from the rear court.
Power racquets give you more power in your badminton shots, but they slow down your recovery time. You are likely to sacrifice speed for power if you choose a head heavy racket.
